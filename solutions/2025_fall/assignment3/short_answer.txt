Make a Class
------------

Q1. What’s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. Const correctness is about marking objects, references, pointers, and members functions as const
when they do not modify observable state. It provides three jobs:
 - documents the intent
 - enforces safety at compile time (compiler checks accidental writes)
 - enables use in more context (allows calls on const objects)
 - helps with optimization

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. It is const-correct if every inspector is declared with a trailing const, and only mutators are
non-const.
The quick check: create a const instance and ensure all read-only functions compile and run.
